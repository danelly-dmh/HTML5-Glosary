   <p id="descrip">The &lt;!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the &lt;html> tag. The &lt;!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.<br>In HTML 4.01, the &lt;!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML.<br>The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly. HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.
