   <p id="descrip">According to the HTML5 spec, “The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.”A section could be used for the equivalent of chapters in a book, or parts of a blog post.<br>It’s important to note that HTML5 in no way does away with or discourages use of the div tag where necessary. Rather in HTML5, sections should be applied to semantically different pieces of content. Divs should continued to be used for styling and other needed segmentation within a document. A section tag can almost be thought of as a “div tag with meaning.”
